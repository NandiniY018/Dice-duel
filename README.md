# Dice-duel

Dice Duel is a simple and fun browser game where two dice are rolled at once, and the player with the higher number wins. If both dice show the same number, itâ€™s a draw. 
With just one click of the Roll button (or by pressing R), the dice roll instantly and the result is displayed at the top. The game is built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
requires no setup beyond opening the index.html file, and works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
